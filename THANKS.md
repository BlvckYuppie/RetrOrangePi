Without the awesome work of Armbian, Libretro, RetroPie, OpenELEC, OGST (Odroid) and other independent developers, ROPi wouldn'be anything as we're not coders. Learning curve has been exponential for us since last year when first ROPi came out. We've been gathering the best gaming opensource software out there and delivering to you completely free-of-charge. 

Thanks to our mates from our FB group and OrangePi Club for the feedback and support. We'll put our donations to good use soon.
